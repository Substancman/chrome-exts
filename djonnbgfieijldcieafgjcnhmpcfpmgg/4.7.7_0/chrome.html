It is intuitive, navigable, and effective. It took me a little bit to open some RAW files, but after effectively opening them, editing and cropping was a breeze."

As someone who doesn't really know what they're doing, this was pretty straightforward, plus having reference links and guides are a major help! Recommend it for those just polishing their pictures up, the pro version seems like it is a nice extra to have, but one can live very well without it."

I ended up buying it as I found it so great. I would definitely recommend Polarr but I don't really want to because it's so good I want to keep it for myself."

Very satisfied with Camera Raw support, and most importantly, I love the fact that it allows for easy offline editing, which means my Chromebook has now become my primary work station! Great app!
